//function takes number of inputs of ids and display information about that episodes

// function decleration

let episodeInfo = (...episodeIds) => {  // ES6 Rest parameter used, for multiple  inputs taken

	{
  for ( let episode of tvShows._embedded.episodes){ 

    if(id == episode.id){  // condition
      
      console.log(episode); //Display output in console

      break;
      
  } else{
  	//do nothing
  }
    } 
  }
} // function end here

//we can pass as many as arguments

let oneId = prompt("enter first episode id");  //first id as argument

let secondId = prompt("enter second episode id");  // second id as argument

let thirdId = prompt("Enter third id ");  // third is as argument


episodeInfo(oneId,secondId,thirdId); //function invoke
